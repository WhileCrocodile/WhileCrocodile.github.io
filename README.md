### Data Visualizations with Tableau
A [collection of data visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/evan.liu1631/vizzes) I've completed in Tableau Public.

### Road Damage Detection System with YOLO
We trained an object detection system based on the YOLO object detection CNN (convolutional neural network) to detect the size and location of road damage using smartphone images.

You can [test-run our work in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ntKCAkGmbv1wwOVDDFbN7EZw6u2nvHk9?usp=sharing) by selecting an appropriate GPU (such as T4) at the top right of the notebook.

### Political Fake News Text Analysis
We applied text mining and statistical modeling techniques to extract trends and biases from the WELFAKE dataset, which consists of over 70,000 real and fake news articles centered around 2016. We were able to train both a random forest model and neural network to identify fake news within the dataset to an accuracy of over 92% and 98%, respectively.

### Stormfront Hate Speech Text Mining Analysis
We applied data visualization, text mining, and statistical modelling techniques to identify rhetorical patterns using a dataset of over 10,000 sentences sampled from the white supremacist forum Stormfront. We were able to detect some key white supremacist ideologies within the text, including beliefs in antisemitism, xenophobia, model minorities, and ethnic discrimination. We also trained a support vector machine and bert-base-uncased transformer to identify hate speech.


### Georgia Parole Recidivism Analysis
We investigated trends in a U.S Department of Justice dataset of over 26,000 individuals released from prisons in the State of Georgia under discretionary parole. We employed data visualization methods, fundamental statistical techniques, and linear models to explore connections between personal backgrounds, criminal histories, and recidivism outcomes.
